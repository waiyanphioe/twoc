# Twoc

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Running Locally

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

Clone the project :

```bash
npm clone https://github.com/waiyanphioe/twoc
```

Go to the project directory :

```bash
cd twoc
```

Remove remote origin :

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

Install dependencies :

```bash
npm install
```

Start a development server :

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
